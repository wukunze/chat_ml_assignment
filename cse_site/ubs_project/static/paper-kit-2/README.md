**Paper Kit 2** is a free Bootstrap 4 UI Kit with pale colors, beautiful typography and thoughtful drawings. We created it having paper and drawings in mind.

Any elements that is vital to code a web project is already here, fully coded. All components are fully responsive and look great on every screen size. Transitions, shadows, colors, they all resemble the flow you would have using pieces of paper.

We have created the UI Kit kit having pastel colors and paper in mind. It feels light, fresh and easy to go through. It features beautiful typography, font icons and thoughtful layouts.

Paper Kit 2 has a PRO version with a huge number of components, sections and examples: **[Paper Kit 2 PRO](https://creative-tim.com/live/paper-kit-2-pro)** . Based on feedback from people that downloaded and used it, we have added needed components and we have created multiple examples pages. We are curious to see how you want to use it and also improve it, so let us know any feedback you have.

## Quick start


We've also included an optional Gulp file to help you get started with theme customization. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js.

1.  Download the project's zip
2.  Make sure you have node.js (<https://nodejs.org/en/>) installed
3.  Type `npm install` in terminal/console in the source folder where `package.json` is located
4.  You will find all the branding colors inside `assets/scss/paper-kit/_variables.scss`. You can change them with a `HEX` value or with other predefined variables.
5.  Run in terminal `gulp compile-scss` for a single compilation or `gulp watch` for continous compilation of the changes that you make in `*.scss` files. This command should be run in the same folder where `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` are located
6.  Run in terminal `gulp open-app` for opening the Presentation Page (default) of the product.
